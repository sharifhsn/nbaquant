One quick heuristic we can use is draft year. Obviously, a player who was drafted in 1986 will not be playing now. We want to pick a cutoff year as close as possible to the currrent year to eliminate as many players as we can. The easiest way to do this is check the oldest players still playing in the NBA, mark them as exceptions, and use their draft year as a starting point.\n",
